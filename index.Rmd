> What are some of the benefits of using it in your day to day work? 

<br>
--

  - Makes translating how you **think** about programming into **actually** programming

  - Code is easier to **read**, especially other peoples code 
  
  - Code is sometimes easier to **debug**
<br>
--
<br>

> Can you describe a scenario where it might *not* be immediately useful?

<br>
--

  - Difficult for **non-linear** programming tasks
  
  - Multi-way derivations that have complex dependencies
  
  - Solution is break steps into a reasonable number of **intermediate objects**

# Dataset 1 Exercises

class: inverse

# Dataset 1, Q1

> Examine the structure of the code used to create adsl. In R, itâ€™s useful to be able to simulate data on the fly in order to test a new package or function. 

<br>

> Type `?runif` and `?sample` at the prompt to learn about these functions

<br>

> Can you describe, **in words**, how the variables `AGE` and `SAFFL` are simulated? 

---
class: inverse, bullet

# Dataset 1, Q1
- `?runif`

- generate random observations from the continuous uniform distribution

- runif(**<span style="color:#00BCFF">n</span>, <span style="color:#89D329">min</span>, <span style="color:#FF3162">max</span>**)

- for our example, `AGE = runif(200, min=18, max=65) %>% round()` translates to ...

--
  
- generate <span style="color:#00BCFF">200</span> points that are uniformly distributed between <span style="color:#89D329">18</span> and <span style="color:#FF3162">65</span>
  
- round result to integer

# runif example
runif(10000, min=18, max=65) %>%
  round() %>%
  hist(main = "Histogram Example")
```
---
class: inverse, bullet

# Dataset 1, Q1
- `?sample`

- generate random samples from an arbitrary categorical distribution

- sample(<span style="color:#00BCFF">x</span>,  <span style="color:#89D329">size</span>,  <span style="color:#FF3162">replace</span>,  prob)
  - <span style="color:#00BCFF">x</span> are the individual values we want to sample
  - <span style="color:#89D329">size</span> is the number of points to be sampled
  - <span style="color:#FF3162">replace</span> specifies to sampling with replacement
  - prob is a probability distribution over the individual values
  
- for our example, `SAFFL = sample(c('Y','N', NA), 200, replace = T, prob = c(.9,.07,.03)` translates to ...

--

- generate <span style="color:#89D329">200</span> values of <span style="color:#00BCFF">{Y, N, NA}</span>, <span style="color:#FF3162">with replacement</span>, where <span style="color:#00BCFF">{Y, N, NA}</span> have probabilities of 90%, 7% and 3%, respectively.
